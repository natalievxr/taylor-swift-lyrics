# taylor-swift-lyrics

This is a corpus of lyrics from Taylor Swift's album, evermore.

Target audience are Swifties, or whoever is interested in the art of songwriting. Initially I wanted to look at how she has evolved her songwriting over the course of her career, but that dataset was too large so I just chose evermore, which is very rich in a lot of metaphors and literary devices.

The data was collected from another github repository of a fan analysing all her lyrics, so I downloaded the raw data from their repository. I just followed the spacy notebook and did what they did.
